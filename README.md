In this project we will Learn to effectively monitor your AWS infrastructure using CloudWatch and Cloud Trail, gaining insights into system performance, security, and operational health.


# Monitoring Infrastructure in AWS (Cloudwatch, Cloud trail)

Imagine you've just launched your startup's new application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Excitedly, you see traffic start to flow in as users begin to interact with your service. However, with success comes responsibility. As your application grows, so does the complexity of managing its underlying infrastructure. How do you ensure that everything continues to run smoothly? How do you detect and address issues before they impact your users? This is where monitoring your infrastructure becomes crucial. Monitoring, refers to the process of observing and collecting data about the performance, health, and behavior of systems, applications, networks, or infrastructure components. The primary goal of monitoring is to ensure that these systems operate effectively, efficiently, and securely, while also detecting and addressing any issues or anomalies in a timely manner.


# AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail

AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to collect and track metrics, monitor logs, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in AWS resources and applications running on the AWS infrastructure. CloudWatch provides insights into the performance, health, and operational status of AWS resources and applications, helping users to troubleshoot issues, optimize resource utilization, and ensure the reliability of their systems. AWS Cloud Trail on the other hand is also a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. Cloud Trail records and logs all API activity in your AWS account, providing a comprehensive trail of events that can be used for security analysis, resource change tracking, troubleshooting, and compliance auditing.

# CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms

Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms are essential components of the Amazon CloudWatch service, which provides monitoring and observability capabilities for AWS resources and applications. Let's delve into each of these components:

# CloudWatch Metrics

CloudWatch Metrics are data points representing the behavior of AWS resources and applications over time. These metrics can be collected from various AWS services such
as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and many others. Metrics provide insights into the performance, health, and operational status of these resources, allowing users to monitor and analyze their behavior.
